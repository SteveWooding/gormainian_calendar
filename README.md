# The Gormanian Calendar Converter Website
A website for converting dates from the Gregorian to Gormanian calendar system.

## About the Gormanian calendar
The Gormanian calendar system was devised by Dave Gorman in episode 7 of
series 3 of his TV show **Modern Life is Goodish**. You can watch it
[here](http://uktvplay.uktv.co.uk/shows/dave-gormans-modern-life-is-goodish/watch-online/?video=4557208837001).

The basic concept is that every month should be exactly 4 weeks long. So 28 days
for every month. This then requires an extra month to be inserted into the year.
This extra month is called Gormanuary.

Another problem with the Gregorian calendar is the Romans. Things that start
with sep- oct- nov- and dec- typically refer to 7, 8, 9, 10. For example,
an octopus has 8 legs. So why are the months September, October, November
and December, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th in the year? Because the Romans
inserted a couple of months named after a general (Julius Caeasr) and an Emperor
(Augustus). Well it's more complicated than that. Go read it up on [Wikipedia]
(https://en.wikipedia.org).

So the solution is to start the year with March, making the 7th month of the year
September and the 10th month of the year December. So that's that problem sorted.

OK, so 13 months of 28 days each adds up to 364 days. So we are a tad short
of the 365 days in a year (366 days in leap year). So we would have an **Intermission**
period to fill in the gap.

If the Gormanian calendar were implemented, the first day of the year would always be a Sunday
and so the same day in a month would be the same day of the week, making life so much more
simple.

of dates. That's about it really.
